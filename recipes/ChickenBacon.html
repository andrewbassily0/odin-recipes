<h2> Description </h2>
<h4>I always seem to have leftover cooked chicken. This simple, tasty salad is a great use of your leftover chicken, either white meat, dark meat, or a combination! Romaine lettuce, cooked chicken, avocado, and cherry tomatoes combine with ranch dressing, and everything is topped off with crunchy bacon. Use purchased ranch salad dressing, or stir up one of the buttermilk dressing recipes on the site. Enjoy for a hearty lunch with some crackers, or for dinner, with a crusty bread. This recipe is proportioned for one person, but it's easy to double or triple for your needs.
